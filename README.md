# polyraptor
Polyraptor implementation in OmNet++.

Polyraptor is a novel data transport protocol, along with flow and congestion control algorithms, that uses RaptorQ codes and
is tailored for one-to-many and many-to-one data transfer patterns in modern data centres. 

The source codes of polyraptor project include the following implementations,  
- various applications for multicasting, multi-sourcing and Incast simulations. 
- polyraptor data transport layer 
- NDP switch
- FatTree topology 
- ECMP routing
- Multicast routing algorithm in FatTree
- several applications to run long and short flows between servers 
- central scheduler node to manage the scheduling of short/long flows in FatTree
- various shell and Matlab scripts to export and plot results

We aim to provide more details upon publishing our first paper on this work soon.
